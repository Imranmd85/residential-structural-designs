# Residential Load Calculations

## 1. Dead Load Calculations

### Floor System
- Concrete slab (4" thick): 50 psf
- Flooring finish: 2 psf
- MEP services: 5 psf
- Ceiling: 3 psf
Total Floor Dead Load = 60 psf

### Roof System
- Roof covering: 5 psf
- Insulation: 2 psf
- Ceiling: 3 psf
- MEP services: 5 psf
Total Roof Dead Load = 15 psf

### Wall Loads
- 8" CMU wall: 40 psf
- Plaster (both sides): 10 psf
Total Wall Load = 50 psf

## 2. Live Load Requirements (per IBC)

- Residential living areas: 40 psf
- Sleeping areas: 30 psf
- Corridors: 100 psf
- Stairs: 100 psf
- Roof live load: 20 psf

## 3. Load Combinations

1. 1.4D
2. 1.2D + 1.6L
3. 1.2D + 1.0L + 1.0W
4. 1.2D + 1.0L + 1.0E
5. 0.9D + 1.0W
6. 0.9D + 1.0E

Where:
D = Dead load
L = Live load
W = Wind load
E = Earthquake load
